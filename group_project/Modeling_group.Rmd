## Group/general info
#Purpose:
This is an R Markdown document for the modeling group project...

```{r libraries}
library(vegan)
```

#Parameters
for Table 1 in the paper - setting parameters for the models
```{r parameter, echo=FALSE}
#VARIABLES
CL  #live coral on open substrate
CD  #dead coral
CP #Live coral on dead coral
ME #Exposed macroalgae
MP #Protected macroalgae
S #Empty space; colonizable by coral or macroalgae

#PARAMETERS (change in proportional cover/year)
gc <- 0.1 #growth rate of coral
gm <- 0.6 #growth rate of macroalgae
gmc <- 0.06 #Overgrowth rate of macroalgae onto live coral
dc <- 0.001 #Death rate of coral
dm <- 0.05 #Senescence rate of macroalgae
e <- 0.01 #Erosion rate of dead coral
gammaC <- 0.001 #Open settlement rate of coral
settlement <- 1 #Multiplier for rate of coral settlement onto dead coral
gammaM <- 0.001 #Open settlement rate of macroalgae
h <- 0.3 #Ambient herbivory rate
p <- 0.5 #Algal protection; degree to which ambient herbivory is reduced for protected macroalgae

#Mads (equation 3)

#dCP/dt = GC* CP*CD + s*gammaC*CD - gmc*CP*(ME+MP) - dc*CP - e*CP
equation_3 <- gc*CP*cd + settlement*gammaC*CD - gmc*CP*(ME + MP) - dc*CP - e*CP

```

#Equation 4
```{r}
#dME/dt= gm*ME*S + gammaM*S - ME(h+dm)
equation_4 <- gm*ME*S + gammaM*S - ME*(h+dm)
```


#Equation 5
```{r}
#dMP/dt = gm*MP*CD +gm*ME*CD + gmc*CL(ME+MP) +gmc*CP*(ME+MP) + gammaM*CD - MP(h(1-p) +dm + e)
```

#Equation 6
```{r}
#S= 1- CL- CD- CP- ME- MP

#Begin model simulation 1
Can we kind of model this off of an SIR model we've done in lab?? I think it would be helpful to maybe diagram this out so we're all on the same page?

#Initial conditions
```{r}
# population size
N <- CL + CP
N<- 100   

# set initial parameter values
		

```

#Set up our storage variables and fill them with our initial conditions. **Note:** Now we'll need one for each "state" of the population.
```{r}
# time steps
tset <- seq(from = 0, to = 60, length.out = 20000) # sequence of timesteps from 0 to 60 with a length of 20000

# holding vector for N (population size)
N.simu1 <- NaN*tset # vector of the same length as tset that is filled with NaNs
N.simu1[1] <- N # set the initial population size

# holding vector for I (infected individuals)
I.simu1 <- NaN*tset# vector of the same length as tset that is filled with NaNs
I.simu1[1] <- I0 # set the initial number of infected individuals

```

#FROM GUIDELINES:
At least one figure* presenting time-series simulations of the model. This figure should show how outcomes differ as a function of an interesting parameter(s). Make sure your figure includes a caption! (If you have many state variables, sometimes itâ€™s helpful for this to be split into two or more figures.)

At least one figure* presenting a bifurcation diagram with respect to an interesting parameter. Make sure your figure includes a descriptive caption!
